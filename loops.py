print("Good morning my neighbors")
print("Good morning my neighbors")
print("Good morning my neighbors")

#an example of a loop
#i is a variable that is used as a counter (1, 2, 3)
#5 is the ending value for counter
  

for number in range(7):
    print("hello world")

for i in range(3):
    print("hello world", i)

for number in range(3):
    print("hello", number)

#While loop - repeats until a condition is met
number=0
while(number < 10):
    print("I love Computer Science", number)
    number = number + 1
